This is the 3-statement financial model I built for my New Venture Capstone Project - 'Complynt'. The model forecasts three possible scenarios, and tries to predict the free cash flow and capital requirements in each case.

Complynt aims to provide AI-powered next-generation compliance tools for small food producers at an affordable price point to handle food labelling compliance, HACCP compliance, and other related regulatory filings. Complynt also provides a marketplace the subscribers with CFIA-certified expert consultants, where food producers can validate the their food labels, HACCP charts, and get all their queries resolved.
